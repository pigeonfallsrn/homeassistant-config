[2026-01-17 08:16] Created HAC_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md (comprehensive AI assistant reference). Documents all HAC commands, data locations, workflows, best practices. Ensures complete transparency and discoverability for multi-AI collaboration. Any AI can now understand HAC system from scratch.
[2026-01-17 08:16] === MAJOR SESSION COMPLETION ===
Built complete garage lighting system (5 automations):
  1. Arrival Lighting (door opens)
  2. House Exit Lighting (walk-in door) 
  3. Motion Keep-Alive (5min timeout)
  4. Departure Auto-Off (20sec delay)
  5. False Alarm Cleanup (3min window)

Completed comprehensive automation audit:
  - AUTOMATION_INVENTORY.md (203 lines) - Complete catalog with status
  - AUTOMATION_HIERARCHY.md (109 lines) - Functional organization
  - AUTOMATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (167 lines) - Prioritized action items
  - Total: 479 lines of automation documentation
  - Status: 17 keep, 3 update, 1 delete (old garage), 5 new

Created HAC_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md (335 lines):
  - Complete reference for AI assistants
  - All commands documented with data sources
  - Common workflows with examples
  - Best practices for multi-AI collaboration
  - Makes entire HAC system self-documenting

System fully transparent and discoverable. Any AI can now:
  - Understand HAC from scratch
  - Find past work in .learnings
  - Read entity context from ENTITY_CONTEXT_MAP
  - Review automation status from audit docs
  - Follow established workflows
  - Contribute to knowledge base

Next priorities:
  1. Delete old garage automation (ID: 1767207374114)
  2. Test new garage system (2-3 days)
  3. Update "Everyone Away" to include Michelle
  4. Complete person tracking (capture Michelle AP at 40154)
  5. iPhone 17 setups for Alaina and Ella (weekend)

[2026-01-17 08:23] Deleted old garage automation (ID: 1767207374114). System now clean with 5 new intelligent garage automations active. Testing phase begins. No conflicts detected on restart.
[2026-01-17 08:28] Updated HAC to v4.1. Added audit commands (list/hierarchy/recommend), docs command, guide command. Fixed paths to ha-context-tools and .learnings. All AI collaboration packages now reference new documentation structure.
[2026-01-17 08:30] Migrated ENTITY_CONTEXT_MAP.md from /config/ai_context/ to /config/ha-context-tools/. Consolidating all HAC documentation in single location.
[2026-01-17 09:35] CLEANUP: Node-RED addon uninstalled successfully. custom_components remains empty; initiating search for moved files before re-installation.
[2026-01-17 09:28] RECOVERY: custom_components directory is confirmed EMPTY. HACS and all dependent integrations (Navien, Yamaha, etc.) must be re-installed. Investigating if files were moved or deleted.
