- 15:07: MCP Privacy Policy: Claude has READ-ONLY access to motion/door/temp sensors for context. Claude CANNOT control and has NO live access to: garage doors (covers), locks, water valves, or network equipment. These exist in context CSVs for knowledge but are intentionally blocked from MCP control/query. If user asks about their state, acknowledge from context but state 'I don't have live MCP access - please check HA app.'
- 15:09: MCP Exposure Audit: CORRECT command is 'ha core info' (works). INCORRECT: jq query on entity_registry/list endpoint - API format incompatible. Always verify exposure via HA UI: Settings > Voice Assistants > Assist > Exposed Entities. No reliable CLI method exists for exposure status.
- 15:09: MCP Privacy Boundaries: LIVE ACCESS via MCP = motion sensors (binary_sensor.*_motion), door sensors (binary_sensor.*_door), temp/humidity (sensor.*_temperature/humidity), lights. BLOCKED from MCP = garage door covers (cover.garage_*), locks (lock.*), water valve controls (switch.*_valve*), network equipment (button.usw_*). Context CSVs contain ALL devices for knowledge; MCP provides live state only for safe sensors.
