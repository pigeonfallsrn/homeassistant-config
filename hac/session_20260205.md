## Session Summary - Morning

### Automations Added/Fixed
1. **exterior_lights_auto_off.yaml** - rebuilt with correct sensors
   - Front driveway ON (motion + dark)
   - Front driveway OFF (5min no motion)
   - Garage ON (walk-in door opens)
   - Garage OFF (5min no motion) - FIXED with real sensor entity IDs

2. **garage_door_notifications.yaml** - created
   - North door closed notification
   - South door closed notification
   - Fixed notify service name

3. **garage_arrival.yaml** - added close reminder
   - 60-second reminder after door opens

### Template Fixes
- **ap_presence_hybrid.yaml** - fixed bssid null checks
  - Added `bssid and` before `bssid[:8]` slicing
  - Added `| default('', true)` for stricter defaults

### Issues Identified
- GPS presence not updating when leaving home - need to configure companion app sensors
- Hue motion light sensors don't expose motion to HA - only internal Hue automation

### Commits
- 92342ea: Fix garage auto-off: use actual motion sensor entity IDs
- 004e869: Fix garage notifications, add close reminder, fix bssid null checks
- 09:20: QUICK WINS COMPLETE: (1) Gist pushed, (2) Verified 5 orphan automations - 4 already gone, removed 2 garage_all_lights_off from entity registry, (3) Tabled projects cleaned. Next priority: legacy template audit for 2026.6 deprecation.
- 09:59: Orphan cleanup complete: removed 2 true orphans. Remaining garage_all_lights_off is legit (unique_id: garage_master_lights_off from garage_lighting_automation.yaml). HA regenerated it on restart.
- 10:47: PHASE 2-4 COMPLETE: Fixed duplicate YAML keys in kitchen_tablet_dashboard.yaml, presence_system.yaml, configuration.yaml. Removed duplicate unique_ids (alaina_at_moms etc). Added round() defaults. Moved 29 old .bak files to hac/backups/old_package_baks/. All configs validated.
- 11:47: HARDWARE CHANGE 2026-02-05: 1st Floor Bathroom - TP-Link dimmer installed for vanity lights, replaces Inovelli. Old Inovelli will move to 2nd Floor Bathroom (smart bulb mode). ISSUE: Remaining 1st FL Bathroom Inovelli (ceiling) not controlling Hue lights properly - needs Smart Bulb Mode check.
- 12:02: 1ST FL BATHROOM INOVELLI+HUE SETUP: (1) Enable Smart Bulb Mode via ZHA Manage Clusters → Inovelli_VZM31SN_Cluster → attribute 'Smart Bulb Mode' = 1. (2) Create automation using fxlt blueprint 'Inovelli VZM31-SN Blue Series 2-1 Switch (ZHA)'. (3) Map paddle presses to light.1st_floor_bathroom (Hue group). (4) Set automation mode: queued. This routes Inovelli→ZHA→HA→Hue Bridge→Hue Bulbs since direct Zigbee binding not possible across different coordinators.
- 21:02: 1ST FL BATHROOM INOVELLI WORKING: Key issue was automations.yaml being ignored - config uses include_dir_merge_list automations/ so automations must go in automations/ directory. Created automations/1st_floor_bathroom_inovelli.yaml using fxlt blueprint.
