- 07:27: Lighting audit: removed 2 duplicate upstairs_hallway_motion automations (IDs 1769232386253, 1769232392078), verified Smart Bulb Mode on 4 Inovelli switches, created kitchen_chandelier Hue group, added AL instance with best practices (separate_turn_on_commands, take_over_control, detect_non_ha_changes=false)
- 11:05: 1st Floor Bathroom Motion Lighting template: trigger=hallway P1 motion, light=Hue ceiling group, night=10%/2200K, day=AL controls, timeout=8min, override=auto-reset on light off, mode=restart. Pattern reusable for other rooms. Vanity upgrade tabled: swap Inovelli to TP-Link dimmer for 3 dumb LEDs.
- 11:41: Automations location: /homeassistant/automations/ dir (not automations.yaml). Config uses include_dir_merge_list. Created bathroom_motion_lighting.yaml for motion automations.
- 11:54: 2nd Floor Bathroom motion lighting added. Disabled 2 old automations: bathroom_red_light_11pm_5_30am + 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting (never triggered). New uses template sensor upstairs_bathroom_motion_combined + time_context. Both bathrooms consistent: 8min timeout, 10pct/2200K night, AL day, shared override.
- 11:56: ZSH CLI rules: 1) escape ! with quotes or omit (use "include_dir" not !include_dir), 2) avoid chaining commands after python3 -c with && on same line - run separately, 3) use single quotes for hac learn strings with special chars
- 12:11: Session summary: HAC script needs update - add automations dir + ZSH rules to Architecture/Critical Rules sections. Fix Historical Learnings grep. See previous session for full proposed changes.
- 13:03: HAC v7.3 script updated: added automations dir + config paths to Architecture, ZSH/CLI rules to Critical Rules, fixed Historical Learnings grep to filter 2026*.md files. MCP privacy verified - token rotated 4 days ago, 0 sensitive entities exposed.
- 13:20: Git SSH to GitHub fixed: created ~/.ssh/github_ha key, added to GitHub, configured SSH config, changed remote from HTTPS to SSH. Removed expired ghp token from repo. Full hac push pipeline now working.
- 14:05: Synology SSH passwordless fixed (chmod 755 home dir). Added hac gdrive command - syncs context/sessions/learnings to GDrive via Synology Cloud Sync. Created multi-lane structure: context, sessions, learnings, config, private, photos.
- 14:27: Created workflow_summary.txt in GDrive/HAC/private - comprehensive reference for HAC commands, sync destinations, privacy model, key paths, and troubleshooting
- 15:35: Lighting audit complete: Fixed Living Spaces AL (separate_turn_on_commands=true), added 1st_floor_bathroom_motion_combined sensor, updated bathroom automation to use combined sensor. All AL best practices verified. 2nd floor Hue lights back online after restart.
- 15:36: 2nd Floor Bathroom lights: ceiling + vanity are dumb bulbs on SPST switch, not smart. Future project: wire hot and replace with smart bulbs or swap switch to Inovelli Blue. Currently manual control only.
- 16:49: System Review 2026-01-26: 112 automations across 23 packages. Lighting: 4 AL instances (Living Spaces fixed today, Kitchen Chandelier correct, Entry Room Ceiling disabled, Bedroom test). Motion rooms: both bathrooms 8min/10%/2200K night, entry 5/10min, kitchen lounge 8/20min, living room 15/45min. All use combined sensors. Inovelli+Hue SBM verified on 5 switches. Tabled: Phase 2 family_activities, 1st floor vanity TP-Link swap, 2nd floor bathroom smart upgrade.
- 16:49: Unavailable entities to clean: Front Driveway North/South lights, Garage LiftMaster lights x4 (ratgdo replaced), Living Room Hue Color Lamps group, Living Room Lounge Ceiling Hue Color group, Entry Room Ceiling Hue White group, Very Front Door Motion sensor.
- 16:49: Rec priorities: (1) Check/recreate unavailable Hue groups in Hue app, (2) Verify upstairs hallway motion automation, (3) Consider consolidating activity boost into main adaptive control, (4) Enable or remove Entry Room Ceiling AL, (5) Delete stale entities via UI
- 16:53: Disabled old 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting in occupancy_system.yaml - replaced by bathroom_motion_lighting.yaml. Fixed upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting to use combined sensor.
- 16:57: Disabled old 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting in occupancy_system.yaml - replaced by bathroom_motion_lighting.yaml. Fixed upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting to use combined sensor.
- 17:00: Fixed Entry Room Ceiling AL: separate_turn_on_commands=true (was false). Updated via .storage/core.config_entries.
- 17:07: Session complete: 5 config fixes applied (2 AL separate_turn_on_commands, 2 combined motion sensors, 1 disabled duplicate). Remaining UI tasks: recreate 3 Hue groups, delete 6+ stale entities, enable Entry Room Ceiling AL if desired.
- 17:16: Front Driveway North/South Hue bulbs: controlled by TP-Link 3-way switch (not always hot). Shows unavailable in HA when switch is off. Not a bug - working as designed. Same pattern as 2nd floor bathroom (SPST). These are NOT smart bulb mode setups - physical switch controls power to bulbs.
- 17:16: Front Driveway North/South Hue bulbs: controlled by TP-Link 3-way switch (not always hot). Shows unavailable in HA when switch is off. Not a bug - working as designed. Same pattern as 2nd floor bathroom (SPST). These are NOT smart bulb mode setups - physical switch controls power to bulbs.
- 17:17: Hue switches inventory: DIMMER SWITCHES: Alaina Bedroom, Ella Bedroom, Garage, Living Room Lounge (not configured). TAP DIAL SWITCHES: Entry Room, Master Bedroom. WORKS WITH HUE (Friends of Hue): Ella Bedroom Hue Light Switch, Living Room Hue Switch, Living Room Lounge Hue Switch. Note: Living Room Lounge Dimmer shows "Not configured in this app" - may need setup or is orphaned.
- 17:26: Hue Bridge: IP 192.168.1.68, Zigbee Ch25, 52 lights, 9 switches. MotionAware areas (4): Alaina Bedroom, Living Rm Lounge, Upstairs, Ella Bedroom - these are Hue-native motion-triggered lighting zones that may conflict with HA automations. Smart home integrations: not configured (Alexa/Google/Matter available but unused).
- 17:26: Hue switch config summary: DIMMER SWITCHES (4): Alaina Bedroom (Concentrate scene), Ella Bedroom (Time-based), Garage (Time-based), Living Room Lounge (SPARE in box). TAP DIALS (2): Entry Room (1st Floor Table Lamps, Time-based, buttons 2-4 unused - candidate for Hot Tub Mode), Master Bedroom (Master Bedroom room, Time-based). FRIENDS OF HUE (3): Ella Bedroom (4-btn), Living Room (4-btn - needs reconfigured for Inovelli fan/light), Living Room Lounge (4-btn).
- 17:26: Hue/HA conflict analysis: (1) Hue Time-based light competes with HA Adaptive Lighting - both adjust color temp by time. (2) Hue MotionAware areas may conflict with HA motion automations. (3) Friends of Hue switches controlling Hue rooms cannot natively control ZHA devices like Inovelli. RECOMMENDATION: For rooms with HA AL control, disable Hue Time-based and MotionAware. Route button events through HA for unified control. Keep Hue direct control only for kids rooms (reliability when HA down).
- 17:28: Govee LED strips (separate from Hue, WiFi-based): Alaina Bedroom has 2 strips named "1" and "2" (need renaming), Ella Bedroom has "Ella LED lights", Living Room has "Living Room TV LED" strip, Master Bedroom LED strip exists but shows in Living Room (wrong room assignment in Govee app). These are NOT in Hue ecosystem - controlled via Govee integration or local API.
- 17:32: Govee LED strips (separate from Hue, WiFi-based): Alaina Bedroom has 2 strips named "1" and "2" (need renaming), Ella Bedroom has "Ella LED lights", Living Room has "Living Room TV LED" strip, Master Bedroom LED strip exists but shows in Living Room (wrong room assignment in Govee app). These are NOT in Hue ecosystem - controlled via Govee integration or local API.
- 17:32: Multi-ecosystem inventory: (1) HUE: 52 lights, 9 switches, Zigbee Ch25, Bridge at 192.168.1.68. (2) GOVEE: 2x Floor Lamp Basic (H6076, LAN Control ON, Living Room), LED strips for kids rooms + Living Room TV + Master Bedroom. (3) AQARA: Light strips (Kitchen_Under_Cabinet, Master_Bedroom_Behind_TV), Outlet in Basement. (4) KASA/TP-LINK: Basement_Hallway switch, Kitchen_Above_Sink_Light switch, 1st Floor Bathroom Vanity (all showing Offline in Govee favorites - wrong app). (5) ZHA: Inovelli switches, Aqara sensors, Third Reality nightlights on Sonoff coordinator.
- 17:32: Govee Floor Lamps (H6076): LAN Control enabled, Matter-capable, FW 1.04.05. Both named "Floor Lamp Basic" (need renaming to Living Room East/West Floor Lamp). These are the AL-controlled lamps in Living Spaces instance.
- 17:32: Aqara ecosystem (via Aqara Home app, likely also in ZHA): SECURITY: 2x Door/Window (Default Room), Water Leak x5 (Kitchen Sink, Dishwasher, Refrigerator + Basement x2), Motion x6 (Kitchen x2, Upstairs Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry Room). Door sensors at: Very Front Door, Entry Room Front, Entry Room (back?), Garage. ENVIRONMENT: Temp/Humidity/Pressure sensors in 1st Fl Bathroom, 2nd Fl Bathroom, Basement, Upstairs Hallway, Ella Bedroom, Alaina Bedroom, Garage. Illumination sensors in Kitchen x2, Upstairs Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry Room (all OFF in overview - not displayed on dashboard). OUTLET: 1x Basement.
- 17:32: Aqara illumination sensors (lux) exist but not enabled in Aqara overview: Kitchen_Motion, Kitchen Table, Upstairs_Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry_Room. These SHOULD be used for lux-based lighting triggers in HA - verify they are exposed in ZHA and used in automations.
- 17:33: Current environment readings (2026-01-26 ~18:30): Bathrooms 70-77F/18-20%, Basement 66F/27%, Hallway 74F/19%, Ella Bedroom 73F/20%, Alaina Bedroom 75F/19%, Garage 53F/25%. All humidity low (winter). Aqara sensors showing LAN mode (local, not cloud).
- 17:37: Integration audit 2026-01-26: Hue 90 devices, ZHA 49 devices, Matter 31 devices (Aqara Hub M3), UniFi Network 62 devices, UniFi Protect 10 devices, Alexa 22 devices, Nest 6 devices, Mitsubishi 4 devices. FAILED: TP-Link Smart Home (7 devices offline - Kasa switches), Android Debug Bridge (tablet). Discovered but not added: 3x Roomba, Synology, openWakeWord, Tuya, Vizio.
- 17:37: ZHA device list shows: Inovelli VZM31-SN and VZM36 switches throughout (1st floor bathroom, entry room, kitchen chandelier, kitchen above sink, kitchen bar pendant, kitchen lounge, living room fan, back patio, kitchen under cabinet). Third Reality nightlights (basement, entry room east/west, garage north, living room north east/west, stairwell, upstairs hallway x2). Smart plugs (basement x7, kitchen x4, living room x5, kitchen lounge x3, garage x1). One LUMI lumi.sensor_wleak.aq1 visible in ZHA.
- 17:38: CRITICAL GAP: All 7 Aqara temp/humidity sensors have no area_id in HA. Need to: (1) Assign areas via HA UI, or (2) Rename entities to include room name. Current mapping unknown - need to cross-reference Aqara app values with HA states to identify which _2 _3 etc corresponds to which room.
- 17:59: Created HA_Master_Inventory.csv with 86 rows covering: 10 devices, 22 lights, 24 sensors, 14 switches, 8 automations, 5 issues, 4 TODOs. Saved to /homeassistant/docs/ and /homeassistant/www/docs/ for web access. Key findings: 3 HIGH priority conflicts (Hue vs HA), Living Room FoH needs reconfiguration, 2 unnamed Aqara sensors need area assignment.
- 18:19: Created comprehensive analysis exports: Issues (79 HIGH), Lights (137 total, 47 need areas), Sensors (292 key sensors, 32 need areas). Files at /homeassistant/www/docs/. Template sensors flagged but dont need areas - theyre logical aggregations.
- 19:48: MASTER INVENTORY SESSION COMPLETE: Created HA_Master_Comprehensive.csv (389 rows) with full system audit. Structure: 4 HUBs, 137 LIGHTs, 223 SENSORs, 14 SWITCHes, 5 ISSUEs, 5 TODOs. Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNSBAAyWreVV2-8cwqefiS9qCrUi2QUt00j2wji29NI/ - File syncs via Synology to G:\HAC. HIGH priority: 30 Hue bulbs need area assignments, 3 Hue vs HA conflicts (Time-based, MotionAware, FoH control), 2 unnamed Aqara sensors. Key TODOs: Living Room FoH reconfig via hue_event, disable Hue MotionAware except kids rooms, Hot Tub Tap Dial button 3 config.
