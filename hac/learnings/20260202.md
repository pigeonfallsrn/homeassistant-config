- 19:59: Hue scene cleanup: Keep only Energize+Nightlight+Concentrate per room. 448 registry scenes after zones auto-created defaults. Tap Dial configs: Entry Room 4-button, Master Bedroom B1=Energize B2=Dimmed B3=Nightlight B4=Off (hold=Entire Home). Tabled: Create Hue groups for Alaina/Ella ceiling bulbs, FoH Hot Tub Mode, Entry ceiling bulb swap to Ambiance.
- 20:22: MOTION LIGHTING BEST PRACTICES (researched 2026-02-02): (1) DEBOUNCING: Use 'for:' on off triggers (60-120s) to prevent bounce. (2) MODE: Use 'mode: restart' for single automation with choose blocks - ensures immediate response to new motion while resetting timers. Use 'mode: single' for separate on/off automations. (3) AGGREGATION: Template binary sensors combining multiple motion sensors MUST have delay_off to prevent cascading triggers. (4) PATTERN: Dual-trigger with IDs (motion_on/motion_off) in single automation with choose block is cleanest. (5) CONDITIONS: Check lux/sun before turning on, not just in action. (6) RACE CONDITION FIX: Ensure aggregated motion sensor has delay_off >= individual sensor clear time.
- 20:51: MOTION AGGREGATION FIXES (2026-02-02): (1) Added Entry Room P1 (binary_sensor.aqara_motion_sensor_p1_occupancy) to entry_room_motion_combined - now has 3 sensors (P1 + 2x Third Reality). (2) Added delay_off: 60s to downstairs_motion_any and upstairs_motion_any aggregates. (3) Added delay_off: 90s to house_motion_any aggregate. (4) P1 SENSOR MAPPING: aqara_motion_sensor_p1_occupancy=Entry Room, _2=Upstairs Hallway, _3=1st Floor Bath Hallway, _6=Very Front Door. This prevents double-fire race conditions on Living Room and global automations.
- 20:51: MOTION AGGREGATION PATTERN: Room-level sensors get 30s delay_off + 150ms delay_on. Floor-level aggregates (downstairs/upstairs) get 60s delay_off. House-level aggregate gets 90s delay_off. This creates a debounce cascade that prevents automation double-fires.
- 21:26: ORPHAN AUTOMATION CLEANUP (2026-02-02): Removed 4 ghost automations from entity registry that were causing double-fires: calendar_refresh_school_in_session_now, calendar_refresh_school_tomorrow, entry_room_lamp_adaptive_lux_control, kitchen_lounge_lamp_adaptive_lux_control. These existed in registry but not in YAML (renamed/deleted). Root cause: HA keeps entity registry entries even when YAML is removed. Fix: Direct registry edit to remove orphans.
