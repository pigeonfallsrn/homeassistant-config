- 11:05: 2026-02-11 AL cleanup complete: Removed 5 ghost instances (bedroom_test, kitchen_entry_ceiling, living_room_ceiling, kitchen_chandelier, pre_release), disabled Upstairs Zone AL. Final config: 2 active AL instances - Living Spaces (4 accent lamps) + Entry Room Ceiling (1 motion light) = 5 lights under AL control. 141 lights remain manual/automation-controlled. Ghost entity conflicts resolved, system clean and working.
- 11:05: 2026-02-11 AL cleanup complete: removed 5 ghost instances, disabled Upstairs Zone. Final config: 2 AL instances (Living Spaces + Entry Room Ceiling) managing 5 lights total. System clean and working.
- 11:29: UI automation architecture: 176 automations organized by function. Categories: Garage (40), Presence (20), Adaptive Lighting (30), Kids (10), Context (10), Safety (10), plus Kitchen/Entry/Living/Tablet automations. Working well, intentionally UI-managed for visual editing and auto-migration benefits.
- 11:41: 151 automations total: 121 in packages/ (feature-based), 25 in automations/ (room-based), 4 in automations.yaml (UI), 1 inline. Packages system working perfectly. HAC ui-automations detector needs fix to scan packages/ directory.

## Deep Research: UI vs YAML Automation Management (Complete)

**Investigation:** "Should I migrate 176 UI automations to YAML?"

**Discovery:** False alarm! Automations already in YAML using packages system.

**Actual Distribution:**
- 151 YAML automations total
  - packages/ (121, 80%) - Feature-based organization ✅ BEST PRACTICE
  - automations/ (25, 17%) - Room-specific Inovelli controls
  - automations.yaml (4, 3%) - UI-created
  - configuration.yaml (1, <1%) - HAC inline automation

- 200 entity registry entries
  - 49 difference = disabled/orphaned/deleted entities

**Why HAC Detector Failed:**
1. Searched for `id:` fields, but entity_id comes from `alias:` field
2. Didn't scan packages/ directory (only checked /config/automations/)
3. Compared wrong data types (entity registry IDs vs YAML automation IDs)

**Key Learning:**
Entity ID generation: `alias: "Kitchen - Light"` → `automation.kitchen_light`

**Tools Created:**
- `/homeassistant/hac/scripts/count_automations.py` - Accurate counter
- `/homeassistant/hac/notes/automation_detection_workflow.md` - Reference guide
- `/homeassistant/hac/notes/automation_architecture.md` - System overview
- `/homeassistant/hac/notes/research_findings_ui_vs_yaml.md` - Full investigation

**Conclusion:** 
System already follows HA best practices. Package-based organization is industry standard for large systems. No migration needed. HAC detector needs fix to properly scan packages/.

**Research Sources:**
- Official HA docs (packages, splitting configuration)
- Community forums (100+ automation organization patterns)
- HA blog posts (future of YAML, 2020-2026 releases)
- Git version control best practices for HA

**Time Invested:** ~2 hours deep research
**Value:** Confirmed architecture is exemplary, documented for future reference
