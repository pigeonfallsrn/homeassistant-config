- 10:01: notify.mobile_app_john_s_phone no longer exists after phone re-registration. New service: notify.mobile_app_sm_s928u. Fixed 85 occurrences across 7 package files. Future-proof: use notify groups to abstract device names.
- 10:34: Adaptive Lighting has 5 instances not 4: living_spaces, entry_room_ceiling, kitchen_table, kids_rooms, upstairs_hallway. Each has sleep_mode switch. Master bedroom and bathrooms are the actual gaps.
- 10:34: Inovelli switch-to-Hue automations are NOT in packages/ - the 3 package files referencing inovelli are peripheral (humidity, tablet, safety). Actual control automations live in automations.yaml or automations/ directory.
- 10:34: Lighting audit: 110+ light entities, 14 Inovelli switches (5x VZM31-SN, 5x VZM30-SN, 1x VZM35-SN fan, 2x VZM36 fan/light, 1x unconfirmed). Only 4 of 4032 entities have area assignments - 99.9% unassigned.
- 10:34: Entity naming: ~30 entities need renaming - generic Hue names (hue_color_candle_1-5, hue_color_lamp_3-12, hue_color_downlight), 2 typos (front_drivay, smart_ligjt), multiple inovelli_vzm31_sn_3/4 without descriptive names.
- 10:34: Blueprint migration: current fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn is VZM31-only and outdated. MasterDevwi unified blueprint supports VZM30/31/35/36 (Dec 2024). Ratoka blueprint designed specifically for Inovelli+Hue Smart Bulb Mode (July 2025).
- 10:34: Hue Room device for Living Room Lounge is assigned to sun_room area - needs correction. Front Driveway Inovelli assigned to entry_room - also wrong.
- 10:50: Kitchen mystery switches solved: 3x VZM31-SN dimmers (a3047d38, da86388f, f671e66f) are 3-way with aux switches controlling dumb LED ceiling lights. Smart Bulb Mode OFF. Total kitchen: 5 Inovelli + 1 VZM36 lounge.
- 10:50: Ella Govee lamps resolved: ella_s_govee_floor_lamp is in Master Bedroom, ella_s_floor_lamp is in Kitchen. Neither is in Ella room anymore. Ella room lights: Hue wall light, 3 Hue ceiling, Hue bedside lamp, TP-Link LED strip.
- 10:50: 1st floor bathroom: Kasa smart dimmer controls vanity (dumb bulbs), Inovelli VZM31-SN (0600639e) controls 2 Hue ceiling lights in Smart Bulb Mode. Both active, no duplicates.
- 10:57: ha CLI does NOT support automation reload. Use API: curl -s -X POST http://supervisor/core/api/services/automation/reload -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
- 15:55: Lighting audit Phase 1 started: 140 lights, 35 areas. Priority fixes: 2 typo entity_ids, ~11 unavailable entities to triage, area assignments for remaining unassigned lights.
- 15:57: Fixed 2 typo entity_ids: front_drivay→front_driveway_inovelli (area: front_driveway), smart_ligjt→living_room_tv_led_strip (area: living_room). No automations referenced old IDs.
- 16:11: Phase 1 lighting audit: ~38 light entities assigned to areas. Remaining: back_door_patio inovelli, 1st floor bathroom inovelli, ~20 more to review. Handoff updated for session continuity.
- 17:54: Phase 1 lighting audit continued: assigned back_door_patio_light_inovelli_switch → back_patio, 1st_floor_bathroom_ceiling_lights_dimmer_switch → 1st_floor_bathroom. Total ~40 lights now have area assignments. Remaining Phase 1: check ~20 unassigned lights (living room lounge individual bulbs, garage individual Hue bulbs, very front door individual bulbs). Phase 2 queued: entity_id renames for generic hue_ prefixes, 11+ unavailable entity triage, blueprint migration, fix Living Room Lounge device assigned to sun_room.
- 17:56: Phase 1 complete: ~42 lights assigned to areas. Remaining 19 unassigned: 3 need immediate assignment (Govee lamps, misnamed VZM30), 5 need triage (Aqara strips, outside_4_west, toy_room_light, Echo Glows), 11 skip (Whole zone, 9 UniFi AP LEDs, 2 hidden ratgdo). Phase 2 queued: entity_id renames for generic hue_ prefixes, 11+ unavailable entity cleanup, blueprint migration.
- 18:08: Phase 2 lighting audit 2/18 ~17:15: Assigned 5 entities (ella_s_govee_floor_lamp→master_bedroom, alaina_s_floor_govee_lamp→kitchen, 3 Echo Glows→respective bedrooms). Disabled 7 orphaned: 3 restored Hue groups (living_room_lounge_ceiling, entry_room_ceiling, living_room_lamp), 4 LiftMaster opener lights. VZM30 already correct. Remaining triage: 2 Aqara LED strips (location?), outside_4_west_lights (what is this?), toy_room_light (toy_room or kitchen?), 6 garage Hue bulbs physically offline.
- 18:10: Phase 2 continued: Assigned 2 Aqara LED strips (aqara_led_strip_t1→kitchen_lounge 'Bar Counter', t1_2→master_bedroom 'TV LED Strip'). Fixed 2 device area misassignments: Living Room Lounge Hue Room sun_room→living_room_lounge, Hue Bridge sun_room→smart_home_av.
- 18:13: Phase 2 continued: Assigned 2 Aqara LED strips (aqara_led_strip_t1→kitchen_lounge 'Bar Counter', t1_2→master_bedroom 'TV LED Strip'). Fixed 2 device area misassignments: Living Room Lounge Hue Room sun_room→living_room_lounge, Hue Bridge sun_room→smart_home_av.
- 18:14: Phase 2 triage complete: Aqara strips assigned (t1→kitchen_lounge bar counter, t1_2→master_bedroom TV). outside_4_west_lights renamed 'West Exterior Lights (4 Combined)' - Hue zone combining 2 front driveway + 2 very front door lights for seasonal/security automation. toy_room_light→living_room_lounge (toy room = living room lounge alias). Device fixes: Living Room Lounge Hue Room→living_room_lounge, Hue Bridge→smart_home_av.
