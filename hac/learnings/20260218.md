- 10:01: notify.mobile_app_john_s_phone no longer exists after phone re-registration. New service: notify.mobile_app_sm_s928u. Fixed 85 occurrences across 7 package files. Future-proof: use notify groups to abstract device names.
- 10:34: Adaptive Lighting has 5 instances not 4: living_spaces, entry_room_ceiling, kitchen_table, kids_rooms, upstairs_hallway. Each has sleep_mode switch. Master bedroom and bathrooms are the actual gaps.
- 10:34: Inovelli switch-to-Hue automations are NOT in packages/ - the 3 package files referencing inovelli are peripheral (humidity, tablet, safety). Actual control automations live in automations.yaml or automations/ directory.
- 10:34: Lighting audit: 110+ light entities, 14 Inovelli switches (5x VZM31-SN, 5x VZM30-SN, 1x VZM35-SN fan, 2x VZM36 fan/light, 1x unconfirmed). Only 4 of 4032 entities have area assignments - 99.9% unassigned.
- 10:34: Entity naming: ~30 entities need renaming - generic Hue names (hue_color_candle_1-5, hue_color_lamp_3-12, hue_color_downlight), 2 typos (front_drivay, smart_ligjt), multiple inovelli_vzm31_sn_3/4 without descriptive names.
- 10:34: Blueprint migration: current fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn is VZM31-only and outdated. MasterDevwi unified blueprint supports VZM30/31/35/36 (Dec 2024). Ratoka blueprint designed specifically for Inovelli+Hue Smart Bulb Mode (July 2025).
- 10:34: Hue Room device for Living Room Lounge is assigned to sun_room area - needs correction. Front Driveway Inovelli assigned to entry_room - also wrong.
