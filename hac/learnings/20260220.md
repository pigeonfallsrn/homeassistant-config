- 06:22: Lighting Audit 2026-02-20: 35 areas, ~140 light entities. Good: dual-trigger patterns, mode:restart, AL override tracking, fxlt blueprint adoption. Gaps: Master Bedroom no AL, Back Patio aux_switch_scenes OFF, duplicate automations (2nd floor bathroom vanity _2, upstairs hallway _2), some custom Inovelli still using cluster 6 triggers.
- 06:22: Lighting best practice confirmed: wait_for_trigger anti-pattern causes stuck automations on HA restart. Dual-trigger (state to on + state to off for:X) is resilient. Community consensus 2023-2026 supports this pattern.
- 06:22: Cleanup candidates identified: upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting_2 (OFF), 2nd_floor_bathroom_vanity_lights_inovelli_control_2 (duplicate), any *_DISABLED_* suffix automations in YAML.
- 06:27: FIXED: 2nd floor bathroom double-firing. Disabled UI-created duplicates: automation.2nd_floor_bathroom_vanity_lights_inovelli_control_2 and automation.2nd_floor_bathroom_fan_inovelli_manual_control_2. YAML versions use fxlt blueprint (canonical). UI versions had raw 21-condition choose pattern. Deletion candidates for next session.
