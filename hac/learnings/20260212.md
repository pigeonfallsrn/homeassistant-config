- 07:05: 2026-02-11 AL cleanup complete: removed 5 ghost instances, disabled Upstairs Zone. Final config: 2 AL instances (Living Spaces + Entry Room Ceiling) managing 5 lights total. System clean and working.
- 07:05: 2026-02-11 AL cleanup complete: Removed 5 ghost instances (bedroom_test, kitchen_entry_ceiling, living_room_ceiling, kitchen_chandelier, pre_release), disabled Upstairs Zone AL. Final config: 2 active AL instances - Living Spaces (4 accent lamps) + Entry Room Ceiling (1 motion light) = 5 lights under AL control. 141 lights remain manual/automation-controlled. Ghost entity conflicts resolved, system clean and working.

- 15:07: MCP Privacy Policy: Claude has READ-ONLY access to motion/door/temp sensors for context. Claude CANNOT control and has NO live access to: garage doors (covers), locks, water valves, or network equipment. These exist in context CSVs for knowledge but are intentionally blocked from MCP control/query. If user asks about their state, acknowledge from context but state 'I don't have live MCP access - please check HA app.'
- 15:09: MCP Exposure Audit: CORRECT command is 'ha core info' (works). INCORRECT: jq query on entity_registry/list endpoint - API format incompatible. Always verify exposure via HA UI: Settings > Voice Assistants > Assist > Exposed Entities. No reliable CLI method exists for exposure status.
- 15:09: MCP Privacy Boundaries: LIVE ACCESS via MCP = motion sensors (binary_sensor.*_motion), door sensors (binary_sensor.*_door), temp/humidity (sensor.*_temperature/humidity), lights. BLOCKED from MCP = garage door covers (cover.garage_*), locks (lock.*), water valve controls (switch.*_valve*), network equipment (button.usw_*). Context CSVs contain ALL devices for knowledge; MCP provides live state only for safe sensors.
- 15:12: URGENT: Water valve control (switch.basement_domestic_water_main_valve) currently EXPOSED to MCP - must be blocked immediately. Also found: basement_avr_hard_reset exposed. Both are safety-critical controls that should never be in MCP exposure.
- 15:15: AVR hard reset correction: User correctly identified this is just a smart plug for AV receiver, not a critical safety device. Low risk - acceptable to remain exposed. Only TRUE safety-critical items are: water valve (now blocked), garage door covers, locks, network equipment.
- 15:22: MCP Exposure Complete: Added 8 motion sensors + 5 door sensors via terminal script. Total safe sensors now exposed: kitchen/living/entry/upstairs motion detection + all door sensors (garage walk-in, front doors, garage bay door sensors). Water valve remains blocked.
