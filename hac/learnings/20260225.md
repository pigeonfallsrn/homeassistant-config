## Inovelli Config Button Hold Not Working - Root Cause & Fix

**Problem:** Config button press worked for fan speed cycling, but hold (to turn off) was not detected.

**Root Cause:** Button delay parameter was set to 0 (instant). With delay=0, the switch fires immediately on press and cannot distinguish between press, hold, double-tap, or triple-tap gestures.

**Fix:** Set button delay to ≥1 (100ms minimum):
```yaml
entity: number.<device>_button_delay
value: 1
```

**Key Insight:** This applies to ALL Inovelli multi-tap/hold detection, not just paddle - includes config button (button_3 on main, button_6 on aux).

## Working Fan Speed Automation Pattern

Config button controls separate Inovelli fan (VZM36):
- 1x press → 33% (low)
- 2x press → 66% (medium)
- 3x press → 100% (high)
- Hold → off

Automation: `automation.kitchen_lounge_aux_switch_controls_hue_ceiling`
- 16:27: 1st Floor Bathroom Inovelli automation was missing (ghost entity in registry). Created blueprint automation targeting light.1st_floor_bathroom Hue group with brightness_pct:100 on up-paddle.
- 16:27: Dumb light switches (direct load control) should have button_delay=0 for instant response - no need for multi-tap scene detection. Applies to: Kitchen Ceiling Cans, Under Cabinet, Bar Pendants.
- 16:27: Blueprint Inovelli automations calling light.turn_on without brightness_pct will restore last dimmed state. Always include brightness_pct:100 in up-paddle action to ensure full brightness on single press.
- 16:33: Inovelli VZM31-SN sends 3 zha_events per button press: level cluster (on/off) + scene cluster (button_X_press). Blueprint triggers on all but only matches scene commands. mode:single + max_exceeded:silent prevents actual duplicate actions. 'Double-fire' warnings are phantom triggers - harmless noise, not real duplicates.
