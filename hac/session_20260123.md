- 09:33: Consolidated 2nd floor lighting: Replaced 3 automations (night_path_upstairs_hallway, night_path_2nd_floor_bathroom, morning_wake_upstairs_hallway) with 2 clean automations: upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting (all time contexts, deep red at night, adaptive handoff day) and 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting (night only, triggered by hallway P1, shower-safe 15min timeout). Disabled morning_wake_master_bedroom in UI. Lines 505 and 570 in occupancy_system.yaml.
- 12:24: Double-fire fix: combined motion sensors need delay_on debounce when OR-ing multiple physical sensors
- 12:50: HAC status double-fire false positives: HA sqlite stores multiple state rows per automation trigger (start, attribute updates). Query should use DISTINCT on timestamp rounded to seconds, or check last_changed vs last_updated to filter actual trigger events vs attribute updates
- 12:50: Confirmed: delay_on 150ms on template sensors works - combined sensor fired once at .879 after east sensor at .726 (153ms delta). Double-fires in status were reporting artifact, not actual duplicate automation runs
- 12:51: Fixing HAC status double-fire query to use last_changed_ts instead of last_updated_ts to avoid counting attribute updates as separate triggers
- 13:26: HAC v7.3: Added multi-LLM commands - gpt, gem, mcp, research - with tiered context levels for token efficiency
- 13:34: HAC v7.3 complete: Multi-LLM tiered output (push/q/mcp/gpt/gem/research), delay_on debounce for combined sensors, last_changed_ts queries for accurate trigger counts
- 16:56: Kitchen tablet dashboard: layout-card/grid-layout causes red error circle on Fully Kiosk tablets - use vertical-stack + horizontal-stack instead. Tablet entity: notify.mobile_app_kitchen_samsung_tablet_wall_mount (HA Companion) and button.kitchen_wall_a9_tablet_* (Fully Kiosk integration). Kiosk mode needs ?kiosk URL param or admin:true for admin users.
- 19:20: Kitchen tablet automation fix: configuration.yaml was using single file include but automation files were in automations/ directory. Fixed by changing to include_dir_merge_list automations/ and moving automations.yaml to automations/ui_automations.yaml. Tablet wake automation uses binary_sensor.kitchen_motion + person home condition.
- 19:20: Kitchen tablet dashboard rebuild: Created scripts.yaml with kitchen_scene_cooking_bright, kitchen_scene_dinner_dim, kitchen_scene_movie_night, kitchen_scene_all_off, plus music scripts (kitchen_play_chill, kitchen_play_dinner, kitchen_play_kids, kitchen_sonos_stop). Dashboard uses verified entity IDs, added music quick-play buttons, streamlined layout.
- 19:20: Best practice automation directory structure: use include_dir_merge_list automations/ to load all YAML files from directory. Allows organized file-per-automation approach while keeping UI automations in automations/ui_automations.yaml
