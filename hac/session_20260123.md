- 09:33: Consolidated 2nd floor lighting: Replaced 3 automations (night_path_upstairs_hallway, night_path_2nd_floor_bathroom, morning_wake_upstairs_hallway) with 2 clean automations: upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting (all time contexts, deep red at night, adaptive handoff day) and 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting (night only, triggered by hallway P1, shower-safe 15min timeout). Disabled morning_wake_master_bedroom in UI. Lines 505 and 570 in occupancy_system.yaml.
- 12:24: Double-fire fix: combined motion sensors need delay_on debounce when OR-ing multiple physical sensors
- 12:50: HAC status double-fire false positives: HA sqlite stores multiple state rows per automation trigger (start, attribute updates). Query should use DISTINCT on timestamp rounded to seconds, or check last_changed vs last_updated to filter actual trigger events vs attribute updates
- 12:50: Confirmed: delay_on 150ms on template sensors works - combined sensor fired once at .879 after east sensor at .726 (153ms delta). Double-fires in status were reporting artifact, not actual duplicate automation runs
- 12:51: Fixing HAC status double-fire query to use last_changed_ts instead of last_updated_ts to avoid counting attribute updates as separate triggers
- 13:26: HAC v7.3: Added multi-LLM commands - gpt, gem, mcp, research - with tiered context levels for token efficiency
