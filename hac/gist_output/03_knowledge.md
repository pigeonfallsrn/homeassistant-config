# System Knowledge - 2026-02-02 20:14

## Architecture Quick Ref
- **Packages:** /config/packages/*.yaml
- **Presence:** input_boolean.john_home (NOT binary_sensor)
- **North garage door:** cover.ratgdo32disco_fd8d8c_door
- **South garage door:** cover.ratgdo32disco_5735e8_door  
- **Walk-in door sensor:** binary_sensor.aqara_door_and_window_sensor_door_3
- **Motion aggregation:** /config/packages/motion_aggregation.yaml
- **Automations:** /homeassistant/automations/ (NOT automations.yaml) - uses include_dir_merge_list
- **Config paths:** /homeassistant/ (not /config/), storage at /homeassistant/.storage/

## Critical Rules (from past disasters)
- NEVER use raw sed on YAML without backup
- ALWAYS use `hac sed` or `hac backup` first
- Check `ha core check` before restart
- Inovelli+Hue: Smart Bulb Mode must be ON
- ZSH: escape ! in strings, dont chain after python3 -c on same line
- HA CLI: ha command doesnt support services - use REST API, websocket, or UI

## Tabled Projects
- 2026-01-22: HA MCP Server Integration - Enable official HA MCP (2025.2+) for read-only device control queries alongside HAC for config editing. Requires: Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Model Context Protocol Server
- 2026-01-22: Cleanup duplicate garage automations - garage_door_opened_close_option vs garage_north_door_opened_close_option, garage_door_opened_close_prompt overlap
- 2026-01-22: Delete orphan automations via GUI: garage_all_lights_off_2, garage_door_handle_notification_actions, garage_door_opened_close_option, garage_door_opened_close_prompt, garage_door_opened_handle_actions
- [ ] Fix SSH key auth to Synology (add ha_to_synology.pub to admin@[IP]:~/.ssh/authorized_keys) then integrate Google Drive sync into hac push
- [ ] Double-trigger still occurring - combined motion sensors may be firing twice. Investigate motion_aggregation.yaml template definition
- 2026-01-22: Fix SSH key auth to Synology for Google Drive sync - add ha_to_synology.pub to admin@[IP]:~/.ssh/authorized_keys, then integrate gdrive sync into hac push
- 2026-01-23: Phase 2 family_activities: Connect winddown sensors to kids_bedroom_automation.yaml, add WAYA softball calendars when season starts, dashboard card
- 2026-01-23: HAC v7.3 Architecture Redesign - Multi-LLM workflow optimization: (1) Dynamic tabled/learnings management with rationale tracking, (2) LLM-specific session prompts (Claude web, Claude Desktop+MCP, Gemini Pro), (3) MCP-aware mode with privacy guards and guided rules, (4) Token-efficient non-MCP fallback mode, (5) Strategic workflow guidance per use case (coding, research, config). See hac/learnings/20260123.md for full spec.
- 2026-01-23: Infrastructure integration: UniFi Protect motion events to HA, Synology automated HA snapshot backups
- 2026-01-28: Add 3 lights to Living Spaces AL via UI: living_room_west_floor_lamp, kitchen_hue_color_floor_lamp, kitchen_lounge_lamp (storage edits revert - must use UI)

## Recent Session Learnings
- 19:59: Hue scene cleanup: Keep only Energize+Nightlight+Concentrate per room. 448 registry scenes after zones auto-created defaults. Tap Dial configs: Entry Room 4-button, Master Bedroom B1=Energize B2=Dimmed B3=Nightlight B4=Off (hold=Entire Home). Tabled: Create Hue groups for [PERSON]/[PERSON] ceiling bulbs, FoH Hot Tub Mode, Entry ceiling bulb swap to Ambiance.

## Historical Learnings (last 30 lines)
- 17:16: Front Driveway North/South Hue bulbs: controlled by TP-Link 3-way switch (not always hot). Shows unavailable in HA when switch is off. Not a bug - working as designed. Same pattern as 2nd floor bathroom (SPST). These are NOT smart bulb mode setups - physical switch controls power to bulbs.
- 17:16: Front Driveway North/South Hue bulbs: controlled by TP-Link 3-way switch (not always hot). Shows unavailable in HA when switch is off. Not a bug - working as designed. Same pattern as 2nd floor bathroom (SPST). These are NOT smart bulb mode setups - physical switch controls power to bulbs.
- 17:17: Hue switches inventory: DIMMER SWITCHES: [PERSON] Bedroom, [PERSON] Bedroom, Garage, Living Room Lounge (not configured). TAP DIAL SWITCHES: Entry Room, Master Bedroom. WORKS WITH HUE (Friends of Hue): [PERSON] Bedroom Hue Light Switch, Living Room Hue Switch, Living Room Lounge Hue Switch. Note: Living Room Lounge Dimmer shows "Not configured in this app" - may need setup or is orphaned.
- 17:26: Hue Bridge: IP [IP], Zigbee Ch25, 52 lights, 9 switches. MotionAware areas (4): [PERSON] Bedroom, Living Rm Lounge, Upstairs, [PERSON] Bedroom - these are Hue-native motion-triggered lighting zones that may conflict with HA automations. Smart home integrations: not configured (Alexa/Google/Matter available but unused).
- 17:26: Hue switch config summary: DIMMER SWITCHES (4): [PERSON] Bedroom (Concentrate scene), [PERSON] Bedroom (Time-based), Garage (Time-based), Living Room Lounge (SPARE in box). TAP DIALS (2): Entry Room (1st Floor Table Lamps, Time-based, buttons 2-4 unused - candidate for Hot Tub Mode), Master Bedroom (Master Bedroom room, Time-based). FRIENDS OF HUE (3): [PERSON] Bedroom (4-btn), Living Room (4-btn - needs reconfigured for Inovelli fan/light), Living Room Lounge (4-btn).
- 17:26: Hue/HA conflict analysis: (1) Hue Time-based light competes with HA Adaptive Lighting - both adjust color temp by time. (2) Hue MotionAware areas may conflict with HA motion automations. (3) Friends of Hue switches controlling Hue rooms cannot natively control ZHA devices like Inovelli. RECOMMENDATION: For rooms with HA AL control, disable Hue Time-based and MotionAware. Route button events through HA for unified control. Keep Hue direct control only for kids rooms (reliability when HA down).
- 17:28: Govee LED strips (separate from Hue, WiFi-based): [PERSON] Bedroom has 2 strips named "1" and "2" (need renaming), [PERSON] Bedroom has "[PERSON] LED lights", Living Room has "Living Room TV LED" strip, Master Bedroom LED strip exists but shows in Living Room (wrong room assignment in Govee app). These are NOT in Hue ecosystem - controlled via Govee integration or local API.
- 17:32: Govee LED strips (separate from Hue, WiFi-based): [PERSON] Bedroom has 2 strips named "1" and "2" (need renaming), [PERSON] Bedroom has "[PERSON] LED lights", Living Room has "Living Room TV LED" strip, Master Bedroom LED strip exists but shows in Living Room (wrong room assignment in Govee app). These are NOT in Hue ecosystem - controlled via Govee integration or local API.
- 17:32: Multi-ecosystem inventory: (1) HUE: 52 lights, 9 switches, Zigbee Ch25, Bridge at [IP]. (2) GOVEE: 2x Floor Lamp Basic (H6076, LAN Control ON, Living Room), LED strips for kids rooms + Living Room TV + Master Bedroom. (3) AQARA: Light strips (Kitchen_Under_Cabinet, Master_Bedroom_Behind_TV), Outlet in Basement. (4) KASA/TP-LINK: Basement_Hallway switch, Kitchen_Above_Sink_Light switch, 1st Floor Bathroom Vanity (all showing Offline in Govee favorites - wrong app). (5) ZHA: Inovelli switches, Aqara sensors, Third Reality nightlights on Sonoff coordinator.
- 17:32: Govee Floor Lamps (H6076): LAN Control enabled, Matter-capable, FW 1.04.05. Both named "Floor Lamp Basic" (need renaming to Living Room East/West Floor Lamp). These are the AL-controlled lamps in Living Spaces instance.
- 17:32: Aqara ecosystem (via Aqara Home app, likely also in ZHA): SECURITY: 2x Door/Window (Default Room), Water Leak x5 (Kitchen Sink, Dishwasher, Refrigerator + Basement x2), Motion x6 (Kitchen x2, Upstairs Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry Room). Door sensors at: Very Front Door, Entry Room Front, Entry Room (back?), Garage. ENVIRONMENT: Temp/Humidity/Pressure sensors in 1st Fl Bathroom, 2nd Fl Bathroom, Basement, Upstairs Hallway, [PERSON] Bedroom, [PERSON] Bedroom, Garage. Illumination sensors in Kitchen x2, Upstairs Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry Room (all OFF in overview - not displayed on dashboard). OUTLET: 1x Basement.
- 17:32: Aqara illumination sensors (lux) exist but not enabled in Aqara overview: Kitchen_Motion, Kitchen Table, Upstairs_Hallway, Basement Hallway, Very Front Door Hallway, Entry_Room. These SHOULD be used for lux-based lighting triggers in HA - verify they are exposed in ZHA and used in automations.
- 17:33: Current environment readings (2026-01-26 ~18:30): Bathrooms 70-77F/18-20%, Basement 66F/27%, Hallway 74F/19%, [PERSON] Bedroom 73F/20%, [PERSON] Bedroom 75F/19%, Garage 53F/25%. All humidity low (winter). Aqara sensors showing LAN mode (local, not cloud).
- 17:37: Integration audit 2026-01-26: Hue 90 devices, ZHA 49 devices, Matter 31 devices (Aqara Hub M3), UniFi Network 62 devices, UniFi Protect 10 devices, Alexa 22 devices, Nest 6 devices, Mitsubishi 4 devices. FAILED: TP-Link Smart Home (7 devices offline - Kasa switches), Android Debug Bridge (tablet). Discovered but not added: 3x Roomba, Synology, openWakeWord, Tuya, Vizio.
- 17:37: ZHA device list shows: Inovelli VZM31-SN and VZM36 switches throughout (1st floor bathroom, entry room, kitchen chandelier, kitchen above sink, kitchen bar pendant, kitchen lounge, living room fan, back patio, kitchen under cabinet). Third Reality nightlights (basement, entry room east/west, garage north, living room north east/west, stairwell, upstairs hallway x2). Smart plugs (basement x7, kitchen x4, living room x5, kitchen lounge x3, garage x1). One LUMI lumi.sensor_wleak.aq1 visible in ZHA.
- 17:38: CRITICAL GAP: All 7 Aqara temp/humidity sensors have no area_id in HA. Need to: (1) Assign areas via HA UI, or (2) Rename entities to include room name. Current mapping unknown - need to cross-reference Aqara app values with HA states to identify which _2 _3 etc corresponds to which room.
- 17:59: Created HA_Master_Inventory.csv with 86 rows covering: 10 devices, 22 lights, 24 sensors, 14 switches, 8 automations, 5 issues, 4 TODOs. Saved to /homeassistant/docs/ and /homeassistant/www/docs/ for web access. Key findings: 3 HIGH priority conflicts (Hue vs HA), Living Room FoH needs reconfiguration, 2 unnamed Aqara sensors need area assignment.
- 18:19: Created comprehensive analysis exports: Issues (79 HIGH), Lights (137 total, 47 need areas), Sensors (292 key sensors, 32 need areas). Files at /homeassistant/www/docs/. Template sensors flagged but dont need areas - theyre logical aggregations.
- 19:48: MASTER INVENTORY SESSION COMPLETE: Created HA_Master_Comprehensive.csv (389 rows) with full system audit. Structure: 4 HUBs, 137 LIGHTs, 223 SENSORs, 14 SWITCHes, 5 ISSUEs, 5 TODOs. Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNSBAAyWreVV2-8cwqefiS9qCrUi2QUt00j2wji29NI/ - File syncs via Synology to G:\HAC. HIGH priority: 30 Hue bulbs need area assignments, 3 Hue vs HA conflicts (Time-based, MotionAware, FoH control), 2 unnamed Aqara sensors. Key TODOs: Living Room FoH reconfig via hue_event, disable Hue MotionAware except kids rooms, Hot Tub Tap Dial button 3 config.
- 21:45: HUE vs HA CONTROL STRATEGY FINALIZED: (1) KIDS ROOMS ([PERSON], [PERSON]): Keep Hue Time-based + MotionAware + Dimmer control - HA hands off, reliability priority. (2) COMMON AREAS (Living Room, Kitchen, Entry, Master Bedroom): Disable Hue Time-based in Hue app, HA Adaptive Lighting controls. (3) GARAGE: Hue Time-based OK (no AL there). (4) FRIENDS OF HUE SWITCHES: Living Room FoH cannot control Inovelli natively - create HA automation using hue_event to trigger Inovelli fan/light. (5) TAP DIAL unused buttons: Entry Room btn 2-4 available for Hot Tub mode or scenes. (6) ENTITY AREA ASSIGNMENTS: Must be done via HA UI for Hue-managed entities - terminal edits get overwritten on restart.
- 22:05: HUE APP CHANGES COMPLETED: (1) Entry Room Tap Dial - changed First press from Time-based to Single scene. (2) Master Bedroom Tap Dial - changed First press from Time-based to Single scene. Both now compatible with HA Adaptive Lighting - no competing color temp adjustments. STILL TODO: Disable MotionAware on Living Rm Lounge and Upstairs areas in Hue app.
- 22:10: HUE MOTIONAWARE DISABLED: Living Rm Lounge and Upstairs areas - HA now has sole control of motion-triggered lighting in these zones. Kids rooms ([PERSON], [PERSON]) retain Hue MotionAware for reliability. All Hue vs HA conflicts now resolved except Living Room FoH switch automation (TODO).
- 22:15: SESSION COMPLETE - Hue vs HA integration cleanup. DONE: (1) Entry Room Tap Dial changed to Single scene, (2) Master Bedroom Tap Dial changed to Single scene, (3) MotionAware disabled on Living Rm Lounge + Upstairs. REMAINING UI TASKS: Assign areas to 6 Hue bulbs via HA UI (terminal edits don't persist for Hue entities), delete stale entities, create Living Room FoH hue_event automation. HAC path confirmed: /homeassistant/hac (not ~/hac or /root/hac).
- 22:11: Entity purge requires UI: REST API homeassistant/remove_entity returns 400. Orphaned entities must be deleted via Settings → Entities → filter unavailable + domain → bulk delete. No CLI method for entity registry cleanup.
- 10:54: Kitchen tablet Spotify playback: Scripts use HA Spotify integration to cast to Kitchen Echo Show (Sonos not in Spotify source list initially). Service flow: media_player.select_source to pick device, 4-second delay, then media_player.play_media with spotify:playlist URI. Fixed tablet_power.yaml - replaced invalid fully_kiosk.load_start_url service with button.press on button.kitchen_wall_a9_tablet_load_start_url.
- 11:48: Config audit cleanup commands: Stage 1 unavailable entities: hac cmd 'ha state list' | grep unavailable. Stage 2 check Hue integration health for bulk unavailable lights. Stage 3 find duplicate entity_ids with grep patterns. Stage 4 area config via .storage/core.area_registry. Stage 5 delete orphaned scenes via UI bulk delete. Key issues found: 23 unavailable entities (mostly Hue), duplicate names (Anyone Home, Kitchen media, bathroom plugs), Master Bedroom area corruption (empty comma), low humidity (kitchen 11.7%), orphaned 'New scene' entries.
- 11:50: Config audit 2026-01-24: 23 unavailable entities (mostly Hue lights - 2nd Floor Bath, [PERSON] Echo Glow, Entry/Front Driveway, Garage LiftMaster, Upstairs Hallway Ceiling), duplicate entity names (Anyone Home x2, Kitchen media x2, bathroom plugs x2, VZM36 lights x2), Master Bedroom area corruption (empty comma in 'Master Bedroom, , Dad's Bedroom'), low humidity (Kitchen 11.7%, 1st Bath 19-24%), orphaned scenes (3x 'New scene' unavailable), double-fire issue persists (calendar_refresh automations need mode: single). Cleanup: UI bulk delete unavailable, fix area registry, reconfigure Hue integration, add mode: single to calendar automations.
- 11:54: Config audit 2026-01-24: 492 total unavailable entities. Breakdown: switch(97), script(75), sensor(68), binary_sensor(47), number(47), button(38), light(23), automation(23), select(20), scene(11), media_player(10). Hue bridge healthy ([IP] reachable) - only 1 Hue light unavailable ([PERSON] ceiling LED). Most unavailable are UniFi PoE buttons (expected), Protect camera motion sensors, and likely orphaned scripts/automations. Area registry has empty alias string in Master Bedroom aliases array. Priority: investigate switch/script bulk unavailable - suggests disabled integration or orphaned config.
- 11:56: CONFIG AUDIT METHODOLOGY 2026-01-24: (1) Check unavailable entities via REST API: curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN' http://supervisor/core/api/states | python3 -c 'import sys,json; [print(e["entity_id"],e["state"]) for e in json.load(sys.stdin) if e["state"]=="unavailable"]' (2) Count by domain: Counter(e.split(".")[0] for e in unavail) (3) Integration configs in .storage/core.config_entries (4) Area registry in .storage/core.area_registry (5) Entity registry in .storage/core.entity_registry. FINDINGS: 492 unavailable - switch(97 UniFi Protect cam settings), script(75 orphaned from deleted definitions), sensor(68), binary_sensor(47 Protect motion), light(23 inc orphaned Hue + Echo Glows + LiftMaster), automation(23). ROOT CAUSES: Scripts exist in entity_registry but definitions deleted (check .storage backups). AI Theta cameras offline. Generic hue_color_lamp_X are unpaired bulbs. Echo Glows cloud issue. Area registry has empty string in Master Bedroom aliases array. FIX PRIORITY: (1) Restore scripts from backup or purge orphaned entities (2) Check AI Theta physical cameras (3) Clean Hue orphans via Hue app (4) Fix area alias via UI
- 23:02: 2026-01-24 SCRIPT PURGE: 75 orphaned scripts (wake/bedtime/timer routines for [PERSON]/[PERSON]/Dad) have no recoverable definitions - .storage/scripts file missing, archive folders empty. Entity registry has references but no script bodies. Purging via REST API. Will rebuild as part of Phase 2 kids_bedroom_automation. Scripts included: wake_up_*, bedtime_*, sleep_timer_*, night_glow_*, all_lights_off_* for each bedroom.
