- 14:21: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Must use fxlt blueprint (fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn-blue-series-2-1-switch.yaml) not raw ZHA events - raw events catch attribute_updated/dimmer changes causing 100+ triggers/hour. Blueprint filters to actual button presses only.
- 14:21: Entry Room Aux switch issue: automation expects button_5_press/button_4_press but receiving attribute_updated - aux switch scenes parameter may need toggle OFF/ON in ZHA device page to actually write to device
- 14:21: Alaina wake automation fix: script.alaina_gradual_wake renamed to script.alaina_gentle_wake - automation was in automations/alaina_wake_echo_alarm.yaml not packages/
- 14:21: Garage arrival approaching automation: Only fires after sunset (-30min offset) - daytime triggers correctly fail condition. This is working as designed.
- 14:32: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Must use fxlt blueprint (fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn-blue-series-2-1-switch.yaml) not raw ZHA events - raw events catch attribute_updated/dimmer changes causing 100+ triggers/hour. Blueprint filters to actual button presses only.

- 14:32: Garage arrival approaching automation: Only fires after sunset (-30min offset) - daytime triggers correctly fail condition. Working as designed.
- 14:39: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: fxlt blueprint already installed but commands dont match - switch sends on/off/attribute_updated NOT button_X_press format. Scene Control parameter likely not enabled. Disabled automation to stop 312/hr trigger spam. Need to check Parameter 12 scene control in ZHA.
- 14:40: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Parameters show correct in HA state (button_delay=8, smart_bulb_mode=on, aux_switch_scenes=on) but device still sends raw on/off/attribute_updated. Must toggle params OFF/ON in ZHA UI to force re-write to physical device, then power cycle via air gap. Automation disabled until scene events confirmed working.
- 14:42: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: fxlt blueprint already installed and correct but switch sends raw on/off not button_X_press - all 21 choose conditions fail on every trigger causing 312/hr spam. Automation disabled via MCP.
- 14:42: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: HA state shows correct params (button_delay=8, smart_bulb_mode=on, aux_switch_scenes=on) but params never written to physical device. Must toggle OFF/ON in ZHA UI to force write, then air gap power cycle.
- 14:42: NEXT SESSION TODO: 1) Toggle smart_bulb_mode OFF/ON in ZHA UI 2) Toggle button_delay 0 then back to 8 3) Air gap power cycle 4) Verify button_X_press in Dev Tools Events 5) Re-enable automation.entry_room_ceiling_inovelli_controls_hue_lights
- 20:01: RESOLVED: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli scene control fix - toggling params via MCP service calls (smart_bulb_mode OFF/ON, button_delay 8->0->8, aux_switch_scenes OFF/ON) + air gap power cycle successfully forced firmware write. Switch now sends button_X_press events. Blueprint automation working correctly.
- 20:13: 1st Floor Bathroom Inovelli: Same stale param issue. MCP service calls alone insufficient - required ZHA UI toggle of smart_bulb_mode + air gap to force firmware write. Now sending button_X_press correctly.
- 20:13: Pattern confirmed: All Inovelli VZM31-SN switches need ZHA UI param toggle + air gap power cycle to enable scene control. MCP service calls update HA state but may not write to device firmware reliably.
- 21:03: Kitchen Lounge Inovelli: automation kitchen_lounge_dimmer_time_based_control NOT using fxlt blueprint - triggers on ALL zha_events catching cluster 6 on/off instead of cluster 64561 button_X_press. All 21 choose conditions fail because command=off. Need trigger filter for cluster_id: 64561 OR migrate to fxlt blueprint.
- 21:03: Back Patio Inovelli (Back Door Patio Light): smart_bulb_mode ON but aux_switch_scenes OFF - scene control disabled. Need ZHA UI toggle + air gap, then create control automation.
- 21:03: Pattern: Custom Inovelli automations without cluster_id filter in trigger catch both cluster 6 on/off AND cluster 64561 button_X_press - causes choose conditions to fail on wrong event type. fxlt blueprint handles this correctly.
- 21:19: Inovelli VZM31-SN button mapping: button_1=paddle down, button_2=paddle up, button_3=main config, button_4=aux paddle down, button_5=aux paddle up, button_6=aux config button. fxlt blueprint only covers 1/2/3 - need custom automation for aux switch events.
- 21:19: Inovelli official fan control pattern (multi-tap): 1x tap=low 33%, 2x tap=med 66%, 3x tap=high 100%, hold=off. Better UX than cycling - user always knows what speed they get.
- 21:19: Kitchen Lounge fix: Old automation kitchen_lounge_dimmer_time_based_control triggered on ALL zha_events catching cluster 6 on/off instead of cluster 64561 button events. Replaced with fxlt blueprint for main paddle + custom automation for aux/config.
- 21:19: Custom Inovelli aux+fan automation pattern: Filter triggers by cluster_id: 64561 AND specific command (button_X_press/hold/double/triple). Use trigger IDs with condition arrays to map multiple buttons to same action.
