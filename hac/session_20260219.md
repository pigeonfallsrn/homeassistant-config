- 14:21: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Must use fxlt blueprint (fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn-blue-series-2-1-switch.yaml) not raw ZHA events - raw events catch attribute_updated/dimmer changes causing 100+ triggers/hour. Blueprint filters to actual button presses only.
- 14:21: Entry Room Aux switch issue: automation expects button_5_press/button_4_press but receiving attribute_updated - aux switch scenes parameter may need toggle OFF/ON in ZHA device page to actually write to device
- 14:21: Alaina wake automation fix: script.alaina_gradual_wake renamed to script.alaina_gentle_wake - automation was in automations/alaina_wake_echo_alarm.yaml not packages/
- 14:21: Garage arrival approaching automation: Only fires after sunset (-30min offset) - daytime triggers correctly fail condition. This is working as designed.
- 14:32: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Must use fxlt blueprint (fxlt/zha-inovelli-vzm31-sn-blue-series-2-1-switch.yaml) not raw ZHA events - raw events catch attribute_updated/dimmer changes causing 100+ triggers/hour. Blueprint filters to actual button presses only.

- 14:32: Garage arrival approaching automation: Only fires after sunset (-30min offset) - daytime triggers correctly fail condition. Working as designed.
- 14:39: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: fxlt blueprint already installed but commands dont match - switch sends on/off/attribute_updated NOT button_X_press format. Scene Control parameter likely not enabled. Disabled automation to stop 312/hr trigger spam. Need to check Parameter 12 scene control in ZHA.
- 14:40: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: Parameters show correct in HA state (button_delay=8, smart_bulb_mode=on, aux_switch_scenes=on) but device still sends raw on/off/attribute_updated. Must toggle params OFF/ON in ZHA UI to force re-write to physical device, then power cycle via air gap. Automation disabled until scene events confirmed working.
- 14:42: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: fxlt blueprint already installed and correct but switch sends raw on/off not button_X_press - all 21 choose conditions fail on every trigger causing 312/hr spam. Automation disabled via MCP.
- 14:42: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli: HA state shows correct params (button_delay=8, smart_bulb_mode=on, aux_switch_scenes=on) but params never written to physical device. Must toggle OFF/ON in ZHA UI to force write, then air gap power cycle.
- 14:42: NEXT SESSION TODO: 1) Toggle smart_bulb_mode OFF/ON in ZHA UI 2) Toggle button_delay 0 then back to 8 3) Air gap power cycle 4) Verify button_X_press in Dev Tools Events 5) Re-enable automation.entry_room_ceiling_inovelli_controls_hue_lights
- 20:01: RESOLVED: Entry Room Ceiling Inovelli scene control fix - toggling params via MCP service calls (smart_bulb_mode OFF/ON, button_delay 8->0->8, aux_switch_scenes OFF/ON) + air gap power cycle successfully forced firmware write. Switch now sends button_X_press events. Blueprint automation working correctly.
