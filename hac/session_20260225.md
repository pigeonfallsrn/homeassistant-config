- 16:27: 1st Floor Bathroom Inovelli automation was missing (ghost entity in registry). Created blueprint automation targeting light.1st_floor_bathroom Hue group with brightness_pct:100 on up-paddle.
- 16:27: Dumb light switches (direct load control) should have button_delay=0 for instant response - no need for multi-tap scene detection. Applies to: Kitchen Ceiling Cans, Under Cabinet, Bar Pendants.
- 16:27: Blueprint Inovelli automations calling light.turn_on without brightness_pct will restore last dimmed state. Always include brightness_pct:100 in up-paddle action to ensure full brightness on single press.
- 16:33: Inovelli VZM31-SN sends 3 zha_events per button press: level cluster (on/off) + scene cluster (button_X_press). Blueprint triggers on all but only matches scene commands. mode:single + max_exceeded:silent prevents actual duplicate actions. 'Double-fire' warnings are phantom triggers - harmless noise, not real duplicates.
