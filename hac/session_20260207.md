- 07:51: 2ND FL BATHROOM LIGHTING FIX:
- Problem: Lights dim because adaptive_lighting controls light.2nd_floor_bathroom
- Solution: Button press activates TIME-BASED Hue scenes + sets manual_control
- DAY (6am-8pm): Energize scene (bright cool)
- EVENING (8pm-11pm): Relax scene (warm medium)
- NIGHT (11pm-6am): Nightlight scene (dim red)
- Use adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control to pause AL on button press
- Scenes: scene.2nd_floor_vanity_lights_energize/relax/nightlight
- Scenes: scene.2nd_fl_bathroom_ceiling_lights_energize
- 12:06: LIGHTING AUDIT SESSION HANDOFF - 2026-02-07

COMPLETED THIS SESSION:
- Fixed 2nd floor bathroom Inovelli (ceiling+vanity separate, time-based scenes)
- Removed light.2nd_floor_bathroom from Adaptive Lighting (was fighting)
- Set up hybrid automation config (YAML + UI)
- Cleaned up duplicate automations (33→19)
- Created entry_room_aux.yaml, kitchen_inovelli.yaml, living_room_av.yaml, first_person_home.yaml

IDENTIFIED ISSUES FOR NEXT SESSION:
1. DUPLICATE: packages/upstairs_lighting.yaml has 2nd_floor_bathroom_motion_lighting_v2 - DELETE IT
2. ORPHAN: automations/upstairs_bathroom_motion.yaml conflicts with Inovelli control - DELETE IT
3. 1st Floor Bathroom Inovelli needs time-based scenes + override (like 2nd floor)
4. Entry Room AUX needs time-based scenes
5. Kitchen Chandelier + Lounge Dimmer need time-based scenes
6. 6 Adaptive Lighting instances need audit for conflicts

BEST PRACTICE PATTERN (implement everywhere):
- Button UP: Time-based scene (Energize 6am-8pm / Relax 8pm-11pm / Nightlight 11pm-6am)
- Button DOWN: Off + clear override
- Button HOLD: Dim up/down
- Motion: Only fires if input_boolean.ROOM_manual_override is OFF
- Override auto-clears after 30 min

ACTION PLAN:
Phase 1: Delete duplicates (upstairs_lighting.yaml bathroom section, upstairs_bathroom_motion.yaml)
Phase 2: Standardize 1st Floor Bathroom (time-based scenes + override)
Phase 3: Standardize Entry Room AUX (time-based scenes)
Phase 4: Kitchen Chandelier + Lounge Dimmer (time-based scenes, keep Above Sink basic)
Phase 5: Audit all 6 Adaptive Lighting instances
Phase 6: Test + document

KEY FILES:
- automations/2nd_floor_bathroom_inovelli.yaml (GOOD TEMPLATE - copy pattern)
- automations/1st_floor_bathroom_inovelli.yaml (NEEDS UPGRADE)
- automations/kitchen_inovelli.yaml (NEEDS UPGRADE for chandelier/dimmer)
- automations/entry_room_aux.yaml (NEEDS UPGRADE)
- packages/upstairs_lighting.yaml (DELETE bathroom section, keep hallway)

HUE SCENES AVAILABLE:

- 12:36: Completed lighting audit 2026-02-07: Upgraded 4 Inovelli automations (1st floor bathroom, entry room AUX, kitchen chandelier, kitchen lounge) with time-based Hue scenes + manual override. Fixed AL config: enabled auto sunrise/sunset for Wisconsin seasonal tracking, added Entry Room Ceiling dedicated AL instance for motion-activated circadian health, consolidated all AL definitions to main config. Key insight: Motion-activated primary lights NEED dedicated AL instances for circadian health benefits.
