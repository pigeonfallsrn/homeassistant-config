- 07:51: 2ND FL BATHROOM LIGHTING FIX:
- Problem: Lights dim because adaptive_lighting controls light.2nd_floor_bathroom
- Solution: Button press activates TIME-BASED Hue scenes + sets manual_control
- DAY (6am-8pm): Energize scene (bright cool)
- EVENING (8pm-11pm): Relax scene (warm medium)
- NIGHT (11pm-6am): Nightlight scene (dim red)
- Use adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control to pause AL on button press
- Scenes: scene.2nd_floor_vanity_lights_energize/relax/nightlight
- Scenes: scene.2nd_fl_bathroom_ceiling_lights_energize
