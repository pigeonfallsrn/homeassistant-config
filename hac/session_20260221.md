- 08:27: DOUBLE-FIRING ROOT CAUSE: fxlt Inovelli blueprint triggers on ALL zha_event, filters by device_id in condition. Each press fires all automations using that blueprint. 14x/hr = normal when 3 bathroom automations share blueprint. Fix: removed logbook.log noise. Future: migrate to per-device-id trigger or unified blueprint

- 11:36: AL Living Spaces expanded: 4→7 lights. Added west_floor_lamp, kitchen_lounge_lamp, kitchen_above_sink_light. Verified working 2026-02-21.
