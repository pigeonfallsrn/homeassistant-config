- 08:27: DOUBLE-FIRING ROOT CAUSE: fxlt Inovelli blueprint triggers on ALL zha_event, filters by device_id in condition. Each press fires all automations using that blueprint. 14x/hr = normal when 3 bathroom automations share blueprint. Fix: removed logbook.log noise. Future: migrate to per-device-id trigger or unified blueprint
- 11:31: AL YAML vs Storage: YAML defines config but AL stores runtime in .storage/core.config_entries. YAML changes need storage edit or delete/re-add integration. Direct edit: ha core stop, backup .storage/core.config_entries, sed lights array, ha core start.
- 11:36: AL Living Spaces expanded: 4→7 lights. Added west_floor_lamp, kitchen_lounge_lamp, kitchen_above_sink_light. Verified working 2026-02-21.
- 12:32: Phase 1 COMPLETE 2026-02-21: All 133 lights have area assignments. AP LED corrections: 2nd_floor_ap→master_bedroom, 1st_floor_ap→kitchen_lounge, tower_flex→back_patio, garage_ap→garage. Unavailable Hue triaged (power issues, not HA). Kitchen 3-way confirmed working (Smart Bulb Mode OFF for dumb loads). Phase 2 ready: entity renames, blueprint migration, AL expansion.
- 13:17: HAC v9 COMPLETE 2026-02-21: Implemented token-efficient 3-tier context system. CONTEXT.md+RESOURCES.md for structured loading. knowledge/ dir for patterns/gotchas/decisions. hac sync combines export+sheets. Recent Learnings tab adds parsed content to LLM Index. ~60% token reduction in hac mcp output.
