- 07:27: Lighting audit: removed 2 duplicate upstairs_hallway_motion automations (IDs 1769232386253, 1769232392078), verified Smart Bulb Mode on 4 Inovelli switches, created kitchen_chandelier Hue group, added AL instance with best practices (separate_turn_on_commands, take_over_control, detect_non_ha_changes=false)
- 11:05: 1st Floor Bathroom Motion Lighting template: trigger=hallway P1 motion, light=Hue ceiling group, night=10%/2200K, day=AL controls, timeout=8min, override=auto-reset on light off, mode=restart. Pattern reusable for other rooms. Vanity upgrade tabled: swap Inovelli to TP-Link dimmer for 3 dumb LEDs.
- 11:41: Automations location: /homeassistant/automations/ dir (not automations.yaml). Config uses include_dir_merge_list. Created bathroom_motion_lighting.yaml for motion automations.
- 11:54: 2nd Floor Bathroom motion lighting added. Disabled 2 old automations: bathroom_red_light_11pm_5_30am + 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_lighting (never triggered). New uses template sensor upstairs_bathroom_motion_combined + time_context. Both bathrooms consistent: 8min timeout, 10pct/2200K night, AL day, shared override.
- 11:56: ZSH CLI rules: 1) escape ! with quotes or omit (use "include_dir" not !include_dir), 2) avoid chaining commands after python3 -c with && on same line - run separately, 3) use single quotes for hac learn strings with special chars
