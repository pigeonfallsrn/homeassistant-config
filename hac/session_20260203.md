- 15:21: DOUBLE-FIRE ROOT CAUSES FIXED (2026-02-02): (1) Motion aggregation sensors (downstairs_motion, upstairs_motion, house_motion) had NO delay_off - added 60s/60s/90s respectively. (2) Six orphan automation entities in registry were triggering alongside current automations - removed calendar_refresh_school_tomorrow, calendar_refresh_school_in_session_now, entry_room_lamp_adaptive_lux_control, kitchen_lounge_lamp_adaptive_lux_control (these had old entity_ids but same unique_ids as current automations). (3) Entry Room P1 motion sensor added to aggregation. RESULT: No double-fires in past hour per hac health.
