- 06:22: Lighting Audit 2026-02-20: 35 areas, ~140 light entities. Good: dual-trigger patterns, mode:restart, AL override tracking, fxlt blueprint adoption. Gaps: Master Bedroom no AL, Back Patio aux_switch_scenes OFF, duplicate automations (2nd floor bathroom vanity _2, upstairs hallway _2), some custom Inovelli still using cluster 6 triggers.
- 06:22: Lighting best practice confirmed: wait_for_trigger anti-pattern causes stuck automations on HA restart. Dual-trigger (state to on + state to off for:X) is resilient. Community consensus 2023-2026 supports this pattern.
- 06:22: Cleanup candidates identified: upstairs_hallway_motion_lighting_2 (OFF), 2nd_floor_bathroom_vanity_lights_inovelli_control_2 (duplicate), any *_DISABLED_* suffix automations in YAML.
- 06:27: FIXED: 2nd floor bathroom double-firing. Disabled UI-created duplicates: automation.2nd_floor_bathroom_vanity_lights_inovelli_control_2 and automation.2nd_floor_bathroom_fan_inovelli_manual_control_2. YAML versions use fxlt blueprint (canonical). UI versions had raw 21-condition choose pattern. Deletion candidates for next session.
- 06:29: Stability audit complete: 5 confirmed deletion candidates (3 duplicates, 1 zombie, 1 replaced). Active double-firing fixed for 2nd floor bathroom. 3 unknown OFF automations need investigation: kitchen_lounge_vzm36_fan_light_hue_ceiling, living_room_tv_off_full_av_system_off, front_driveway_lights_on_when_motion_dark.
- 12:10: Front driveway motion automation disabled - UniFi Protect doorbell motion too sensitive (triggers on road traffic). PRN: Adjust motion zones in UniFi Protect app before re-enabling automation.front_driveway_lights_on_when_motion_dark
- 13:55: Arrival System Consolidation 2026-02-20: Merged two separate arrival automations into unified system. Bluetooth HandsFreeLink sensor was broken (entity not found). Best practice: person state trigger with garage buttons in single notification. Auto-open dashboard discouraged for daily use. Added departure garage-open alert with snooze.
- 14:57: HA CLI limitation: 'ha' command does NOT support 'services' subcommand. For service calls from terminal use REST API: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" http://supervisor/core/api/services/DOMAIN/SERVICE
- 15:44: Arrival/Departure system complete 2026-02-20: Unified notification has North/South/Dashboard buttons. Departure alert triggers 30s after leaving if garage open with Close/Snooze30/Ignore options. Snooze re-alerts after 30min if still away+open. Autoclear on return. Broken Bluetooth automation left in place (wont fire without sensor). Entity IDs based on alias not id: automation.arrival_john_home, automation.arrival_handle_notification_actions.
- 15:56: 14 unassigned lights identified - mostly Hue groups. 2 AL instances active: Living Spaces, Entry Room Ceiling
- 16:03: MCP bulk area assignment: 11 lights assigned - 1st_floor_bathroom(1), 2nd_floor_bathroom(1), ella_s_bedroom(3), alaina_s_bedroom(3), front_driveway(3). 3 orphan hue_color_lamp entities confirmed non-existent (deleted from Hue). Garage ceiling lights unavailable (load disconnected).
- 16:05: Lighting recommendations handoff created: session_handoff_lighting_recommendations.md - P1 items: Master Bedroom AL, Bathroom night modes. Entry room double-firing flagged (6x/hr).
- 16:11: Automation deletion audit: 4 CONFIRMED DUPLICATES ready for deletion (2nd_floor_bathroom_vanity_2, 2nd_floor_bathroom_fan_2, upstairs_hallway_motion_2, 2nd_floor_bathroom_night_2). 5 OFF AUTOMATIONS need investigation: front_driveway_motion (UniFi sensitivity - documented), kitchen_lounge_dimmer, kitchen_lounge_vzm36, living_room_tv_av_off, morning_wake_master_bedroom. Total 141 automations, 9 currently OFF.
