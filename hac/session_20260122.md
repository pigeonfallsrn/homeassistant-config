- 18:53: HAC v7.0 deployed - secret gist, auto-backup, safe sed, privacy sanitization
- 20:12: Fixed apply_context_on_time_change double-fire by removing redundant sun/time triggers (sensor.time_context already handles those transitions). Cleaned up .backup files from packages dir.
- 20:15: Fixed apply_context_on_time_change double-fire by removing redundant sun/time triggers (sensor.time_context already handles those transitions). Cleaned up .backup files from packages dir.
- 20:20: HAC v7.1 deployed: audit, sed --preview, diff, restore, check, hygiene. Fixed context_apply_on_time_change double-fire. Monitor 21:00 for calendar_refresh_school_in_session_now.
- 21:13: HAC v7.2: Python sanitizer with entity ID preservation. Sanitizes zone names, addresses, emails, IPs. Preserves snake_case entity IDs for debugging.
- 22:00: Fixed garage lights staying on - OFF trigger now fires after 6min in any state (removed 'to: off'). Migrated garage door notifications to native alert: integration with input_datetime snooze (survives restarts). Added South door quick close option. Reduced close notification delay 5s→2s. Added arrival lights automation (driveway + garage at night when approaching).
- 22:53: Adaptive lighting best practices: 1) Use lux-based triggers not sun.sun for precision, 2) Add activity boost automation to restore brightness when motion detected while dimmed, 3) Use consistent motion sensors (aggregated) for both on and timeout triggers, 4) Use platform:time with sensor for reliable hard-off (not template string match), 5) Remove redundant per-room everyone-left automations when global exists, 6) Tune timeouts per room type: transition spaces 5/10min, active areas 8/20min, relaxation areas 15/45min, 7) Add brightness gate (above 50) on dim automations to prevent re-dimming, 8) Keep lux sensors in motion_aggregation.yaml for centralized management.
