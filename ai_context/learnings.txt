[2026-01-16 16:35] Backup created: /config/backups/hac_20260116_163558
[2026-01-16 16:35] Home garage: 2-stall, 2 ratgdo devices (north/south doors), 6 Hue lights (2 ceiling + 4 door lights not wired hot = unreliable). Need automation: all lights on/off together with door open/motion triggers. Walk-in door has Aqara sensor.
[2026-01-16 16:35] Navien combi boiler system: 4 zones via Taco controller. Zone 1: Basement cast iron radiators (64°F). Zone 2: 1st floor in-floor PEX radiant with mixing valve (69°F, works great). Zone 3: Upstairs 5 radiators (Master/Ella/Alaina bedrooms, hallway, bathroom) - TRV project in progress with Sonoff Zigbee planned. Zone 4: Garage baseboard (61°F, undersized but adequate).
[2026-01-16 16:35] Mitsubishi mini-splits: 4 units total. 1st floor (kitchen + living room), 2nd floor hallway (insufficient summer cooling for bedrooms - future fan automation desired), 3rd floor attic (future living space, currently sheetrocked/primed only, needs electrical).
[2026-01-16 16:35] Big Garage (40003 Commercial Ave): Freeze protection only at 50°F baseline (intentional). 2 natural gas ceiling furnaces (PFP East/West), both set to 50°F. Ceiling fans run constantly (poor circulation - future automation: run fans when loft temp exceeds floor by X degrees). Manual warm-up via Nest app when working/washing trucks.
[2026-01-16 16:35] Big Garage future deployment: Additional HA Green (already owned), local control via UBB bridge. Projects: 5 commercial overhead doors 12x14 (Overhead Doors brand, circa 1997, RF remote unreliable, pneumatic safety broken), 2 walk-in doors (replace Kwikset WiFi locks with HA-compatible), ceiling fan temp-delta automation, work session heating boost, security lighting.
[2026-01-16 16:35] Big Garage tenants/access: Brian Borreson (neighbor, permanent access), Virgil Helgeson (stores Nova car, temporary Kwikset codes). Future: HA-compatible smart locks for local control and better access management.
[2026-01-16 16:35] Property portfolio: Personal residence 40154 US Hwy 53 (home). PFLC (Pigeon Falls Lawn Care) = service business (PigeonFallsLawnCare@gmail.com).

[2026-01-16 16:49] Person entity question: 'Jean Spencer' exists but unclear who this is. May be John's mother or other family member - needs clarification before removing.
[2026-01-16 16:49] Backup created: /config/backups/hac_20260116_164944
[2026-01-16 16:49] Jean Spencer is John's mother (retired). Has Samsung S25, visits occasionally to help with girls/laundry/household. No HA mobile app needed. Device tracker to be added when she visits next.
[2026-01-16 16:49] Goetting WiFi SSID = Michelle's house (40062 US Hwy 53) only. Any device on Goetting WiFi means physically at 40062, not 40154. Michelle/Jarrett/Owen presence on Goetting WiFi = they are home at their house (40062).
[2026-01-16 16:49] Michelle's work schedule: M-F (except Wednesday off), weekends off. Michelle's Work Laptop (192.168.28.185) connected = Michelle working from home. CRITICAL: Network stability required for her work - prioritize Goetting WiFi/UBB bridge reliability.
[2026-01-16 16:49] Person entities clarified: John Spencer (son), Jean Spencer (John's mother, occasional visitor). Michelle Goetting (tenant/family at 40062), Jarrett Goetting (Michelle's son at 40062), Owen Goetting (Michelle's son at 40062). Alaina Spencer & Ella Spencer (John's daughters at 40154).
[2026-01-16 16:49] Automation opportunity: Michelle's work presence detection. If Michelle's Work Laptop online M/Tu/Th/F 8am-5pm = working from home, ensure network priority/stability. Wednesday/weekends = not working.
[2026-01-16 16:49] Owen is young (has Nanit baby monitor cam 192.168.28.7), explaining why only tablet, no phone. Jarrett older (Echo Show, multiple TVs). Boys share Nintendo Switch and Fire Tablet.
[2026-01-16 23:00] MASTER_PROJECT_PLAN.md and AI_HANDOFF.md created for multi-AI collaboration. All context consolidated in /config/ai_context/. System ready for handoffs to Gemini/ChatGPT.
