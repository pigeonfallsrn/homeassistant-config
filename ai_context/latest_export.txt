RECENT PROGRESS:
[2026-01-16 18:17] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Created binary_sensor.michelle_present_goetting_wifi (Template Presence) using UniFi essid from device_tracker.michelle_s_iphone_14_pro; verifies Michelle on Goetting WiFi at 40062.
[2026-01-16 18:18] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Created binary_sensor.michelle_present_goetting_wifi (Template Presence) using UniFi essid from device_tracker.michelle_s_iphone_14_pro; confirms ON when connected to Goetting WiFi at 40062.
[2026-01-16 19:35] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Refreshed HAC entity cache via /config/ha-context-tools/ha-export-all so hac e searches reflect current entities (cache was stale since 2025-11-05).
[2026-01-16 19:36] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Ran /config/ha-context-tools/ha-export-all to refresh /config/.ha-context-cache/entities.yaml (was stale since 2025-11-05); hac e search now reflects current entities including binary_sensor.michelle_present_goetting_wifi.
[2026-01-16 21:39] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Updated binary_sensor.michelle_phone_at_michelle_s_house_40062 to use UniFi ap_mac (60:22:32:3d:b6:44) as primary location proof for 40062, with SSID 'Goetting' as fallback.
[2026-01-16 21:45] ChatGPT 2026-01-16: Standardized Michelle micro-location using UniFi AP MAC as primary proof (SSID fallback).  Created/validated binary_sensor.michelle_phone_at_michelle_s_house_40062.  Next step: capture ap_mac when her iPhone is on John’s home AP to build binary_sensor.michelle_phone_at_john_s_house_40154, then roll up to a single binary_sensor.michelle_present.
[2026-01-16 21:47] End of session 2026-01-16 with Claude. HAC v4.0 validated with ChatGPT (made significant progress on presence sensors) and Gemini. System ready for multi-AI collaboration. Next session: continue presence work, iPhone setups weekend, garage lighting.
[2026-01-16 21:49] Created ENTITY_CONTEXT_MAP.md - maps entities to real-world context, learnings, configs. Enriches AI understanding of WHY entities exist and HOW they're used. Next: automate entity-learning linkage analysis.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
- Generate commands for me to run
- Analyze outputs I paste
- Reference context files
- Update learnings when done

NEXT PRIORITIES:
1. Complete person tracking setup
2. Solve garage lighting
3. Create Michelle zone
