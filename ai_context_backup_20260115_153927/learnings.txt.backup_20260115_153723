[Wed Jan 14 09:59:24 CST 2026] COMPLETE FIX: Entry Room Inovelli + Hue Smart Bulb Control

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Entry Room VZM31-SN switch automation not controlling Hue bulbs
- Multiple root causes identified through systematic troubleshooting

ROOT CAUSES FOUND:
1. Wrong entity names in automation (light.entry_room_ceiling_hue_white_lights vs actual individual lights)
2. Adaptive Lighting switch command failing and blocking automation
3. Individual Hue bulbs hidden by integration (hidden_by: integration)
4. Smart Bulb Mode was already enabled (not the issue)

SOLUTION APPLIED:
1. Used Python to parse YAML and replace entity names recursively throughout automation
2. Removed Adaptive Lighting switch.turn_on commands that were failing
3. Unhid the individual light entities in core.entity_registry
4. Entities: light.entry_rm_ceiling_hue_white_1_2 and light.entry_rm_ceiling_hue_white_2_2
5. Device: Entry Room Ceiling Light Inovelli Smart Dimmer (VZM31-SN)
6. Device ID: d80c7fa6d013f0fd1cbdd6f67c6a1cac
7. IEEE: 8c:8b:48:ff:fe:4d:18:9f

KEY LESSONS:
- NEVER use sed to delete lines in live config files (caused 200+ automation loss)
- ALWAYS use Python with proper YAML parsing for complex config edits
- Check if entities are hidden_by: integration when automations don't work
- Hue creates group entities but hides individuals - unhide them for direct control
- Smart Bulb Mode must be enabled for switch to not cut power to bulbs
- When Adaptive Lighting is disabled, remove its service calls from automations

WORKING AUTOMATIONS:
- Entry Room - Inovelli Ceiling Lights (main switch, blueprint)
- Entry Room - AUX Switch Controls (aux switch, manual)

STATUS: ✅ BOTH SWITCHES WORKING
[Wed Jan 14 09:59:34 CST 2026] REMAINING WORK - Back Patio Switch:
- Device: Back Door Patio Light Inovelli Switch (VZM30-SN)
- Device ID: 70c1c990c1792ade4fc2eb2fd0d8487a
- Current automation exists but needs testing
- Apply same fix pattern as Entry Room if needed
- Check for hidden entities, wrong entity names, adaptive lighting conflicts
[2026-01-14 10:00] COMPLETE FIX: Entry Room Inovelli + Hue Smart Bulb Control - Both main and AUX switches working after fixing entity names, removing Adaptive Lighting commands, and unhiding hidden Hue bulb entities
[2026-01-14 10:00] REMAINING: Back Patio switch (device_id: 70c1c990c1792ade4fc2eb2fd0d8487a) needs testing
[2026-01-14 14:56] COMPLETE FIX: Entry Room Inovelli + Hue Smart Bulb Control - Both main and AUX switches working after fixing entity names, removing Adaptive Lighting commands, and unhiding hidden Hue bulb entities
[2026-01-14 14:56] REMAINING: Back Patio switch (device_id: 70c1c990c1792ade4fc2eb2fd0d8487a) needs testing
[2026-01-14 15:28] Back Patio Complete: VZM30-SN controlling light.back_patio_steps_light with scene cycling - UP=Bright(100%/4000K), CONFIG cycles through Bright→Evening(60%/2700K)→Hot Tub(20%/amber)→Off, DOWN=Off. Smart Bulb Mode enabled.
[2026-01-14 15:28] Session Success: All 3 Inovelli+Hue setups working: Kitchen Chandelier, Entry Room (main+AUX), Back Patio (with scene cycling). Key fixes: entity names, hidden entities, Smart Bulb Mode, button commands, Adaptive Lighting removal.
[2026-01-14 21:34] NEVER use sed for YAML - use Python with yaml.safe_load
[2026-01-14 21:34] Inovelli switches need Smart Bulb Mode ON for Hue control
[2026-01-14 21:34] Hue hides entities with hidden_by: integration - unhide via Python
[2026-01-14 21:34] VZM30-SN and VZM31-SN use button_X_press not move_to_level
[2026-01-14 21:34] Always backup before edits: cp file.yaml file.yaml.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
[2026-01-14 21:34] Check hidden entities: grep ENTITY /config/.storage/core.entity_registry | grep hidden_by
[2026-01-14 21:35] Scene cycling on Back Patio works with button_3_press conditions
[2026-01-14 23:07] Cleaned up 201 ghost automations from entity registry after sed disaster - kept 17 working automations
[2026-01-15 07:02] Successfully cleaned entity registry - removed 184 ghost automations after stopping HA. Final count: 17 working automations, down from 201 ghosts
[2026-01-15 07:04] HAC v2.0 system fully tested and operational
[2026-01-15 08:55] sed disaster wiped Mobile App integrations for Alaina and Ella's phones. Solution: reinstall HA Companion app on their iPhone 17s, grant location permissions, then manually link new device_trackers to person entities in Settings → People
[2026-01-15 15:07] Always chain commands using && for safety. Recovered Navien integration by manually downloading files from nikshriv/hass_navien_water_heater to config/custom_components/navien_water_heater after sed disaster deleted them.
[2026-01-15 15:19] Executed session cache purge with backup and disabled Navien to resolve bootstrap deadlock. Chained using && for safety.
