# Quick Start for ChatGPT/Gemini

When John pastes `hac` output to you:

1. **Read AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md first** (this is in his Google Drive)
2. **Key rules**:
   - Commands ONE at a time
   - Use ZHA (not Zigbee2MQTT)
   - Run `ha core check` before `ha core restart`
3. **Reference baseline** when you need entity details
4. **Check learning log** for past solutions
5. **At end**: Remind John to run `haclearn "what we solved"`

**John's style**: Direct, technical, no hand-holding. Show commands, explain why.
