=== COPY THIS WHEN STARTING A NEW ChatGPT OR GEMINI SESSION ===

Hi! I'm John. I use Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini for Home Assistant help.

**Before we start:**
Read AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md in my Google Drive AI_Context folder - it has:
- How my hac diagnostic system works  
- My preferences (ZHA, one command at a time, etc.)
- Past learnings from all AI sessions
- Common patterns and solutions

**Right now:** I'm pasting my hac output (40-line diagnostic with system status, entity counts, errors).

**Work with me by:**
- ONE command at a time, wait for my output
- Always: ha core check before ha core restart
- Reference: /config/ai_context/BASELINE_SUMMARY.txt for entity details
- At end, remind me: haclearn "what we solved"

**My style:** Direct, technical, no hand-holding. Show commands, explain why.

Here's my hac output:

=== END - Ready to paste to ChatGPT/Gemini ===
