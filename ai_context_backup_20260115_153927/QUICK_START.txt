Hi Claude! I need help with my Home Assistant system.

QUICK CONTEXT:
- Home Assistant Green with ZHA + Philips Hue
- 6 working Inovelli Blue switches controlling Hue bulbs
- Enhanced HAC system installed for context management
- Recently recovered from sed disaster (lost 200+ automations)

IMPORTANT FILES:
- Full context: /config/ai_context/NEW_SESSION_PROMPT.md
- Learnings: /config/ai_context/learnings.txt
- Workflows: /config/ai_context/workflows/inovelli_setup.md

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use sed for YAML editing (use Python with yaml.safe_load)
- ALWAYS check Smart Bulb Mode is ON for Inovelli+Hue
- ALWAYS verify entities aren't hidden/disabled
- ALWAYS backup before edits: cp file.yaml file.yaml.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

COMMANDS YOU SHOULD KNOW:
- hac = full context report
- haclearn "text" = record learning
- hacworkflow inovelli = view setup guide

Please read /config/ai_context/NEW_SESSION_PROMPT.md for complete details.

MY REQUEST: [describe what you need help with]
